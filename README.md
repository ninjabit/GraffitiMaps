# GraffitiMaps

## Intro
GraffitiMaps is a free and opensource multiplatform project intended to provide a wiki like environment where to track all the Graffitis in the world.

It's free and opensource, respecting the real Streetart ecosystem.

It allows anonymous accounts, to let the artists (or everyone else) share their creations.

It allows any type of content, until it's pertinent to the Streetart's world.

Inappropriate content will be removed from the community itself, once it's active. Until then some volunteer staff will lend its hand for this task.

Arts attribution to artists is done through a percentile system, which enforce the democratic approach of the entire platform.

Artists and other users share the same privileges and functionalities.
Any user will need to gain respect-points (kudos) within the platform to be able to perform specific actions, like moderating and editing.
